# Security Policy test change

## Supported Versions

It is strongly encouraged to keep the launcher updated to the latest 1.x version, which will include the most up-to-date features and security (there are no plans for a 2.x branch).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report (suspected) security vulnerabilities privately to dbhdane@outlook.com. You will receive a response from me within 48 hours. If the issue is confirmed, I will release a new version on https://beta.freeso.org as soon as possible depending on complexity, but historically within a few days.

## Receiving security updates

Important security notifications will be distributed via the following methods:

* Official FreeSO Discord
